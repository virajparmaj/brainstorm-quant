# Quant Project Brainstorm Repository

This repository is a structured space to explore, brainstorm, and progressively build quantitative research and ML-based trading strategies.

## Objective
Create a portfolio of high-impact quant research ideas and implementation pipelines that can be extended into:
- Trading/algo development
- Research papers
- Fellowship applications
- Hedge fund portfolio case studies

## Core Areas
1. **Basket Trading Optimization using Bayesian Optimization**
2. **Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) Portfolio Models**
3. **Derivative Hedging using Reinforcement Learning**

## Contribution Philosophy
- Log ideas daily (even small ones).
- Push WIP notebooks, design sketches, pseudo-code.
- Use tags like `[IDEA]`, `[TODO]`, `[PAPER]`, `[SIMULATION]`.
- Weekly consolidation into structured research.

## Future Extensions
- High-frequency strategies
- Regime detection (macro-credit model extension)
- Market microstructure ML
- Risk models (GARCH++, multimodal)
